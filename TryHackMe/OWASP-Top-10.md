# Day 2: Broken Authentication 
Authentication and session management constitute core components of modern web applications. Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. The most common form of authentication is using a username and password mechanism. A user would enter these credentials, the server would verify them. If they are correct, the server would then provide the users’ browser with a session cookie. A session cookie is needed because web servers use HTTP(S) to communicate which is stateless. Attaching session cookies means that the server will know who is sending what data. The server can then keep track of users' actions. 

If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other users’ accounts. This would allow the attacker to access sensitive data (depending on the purpose of the application). Some common flaws in authentication mechanisms include:

- Brute force attacks: If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker is able to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts. 
- Use of weak credentials: web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as ‘password1’ or common passwords, then an attacker is able to easily guess them and access user accounts. They can do this without brute forcing and without multiple attempts.
- Weak Session Cookies: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, an attacker can set their own session cookies and access users’ accounts. 

There can be various mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms depending on the exact flaw:

- To avoid password guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy. 
- To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute force attacks.
- Implement Multi Factor Authentication - If a user has multiple methods of authentication, for example, using username and passwords and receiving a code on their mobile device, then it would be difficult for an attacker to get access to both credentials to get access to their account.



For this example, we'll be looking at a logic flaw within the authentication mechanism.

A lot of times what happens is that developers forgets to sanitize the input(username & password) given by the user in the code of their application, which can make them vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection. However, we are going to focus on a vulnerability that happens because of a developer's mistake but is very easy to exploit i.e re-registration of an existing user.

Let's understand this with the help of an example, say there is an existing user with the name admin and now we want to get access to their account so what we can do is try to re-register that username but with slight modification. We are going to enter " admin"(notice the space in the starting). Now when you enter that in the username field and enter other required information like email id or password and submit that data. It will actually register a new user but that user will have the same right as normal admin. That new user will also be able to see all the content presented under the user admin.

To see this in action go to http://MACHINE_IP:8888 and try to register a user name darren, you'll see that user already exists so then try to register a user " darren" and you'll see that you are now logged in and will be able to see the content present only in Darren's account which in our case is the flag that you need to retrieve.

# Day 3: Sensitive Data Exposure 
The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format that is easily accessible from many locations at once is in a database. This is obviously perfect for something like a web application, as there may be many users interacting with the website at any one time. Database engines usually follow the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax; however, alternative formats (such as NoSQL) are rising in popularity.


In a production environment it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers, running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These databases are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer. This is much easier than setting up a full database server, and so could potentially be seen in smaller web applications. Accessing a database server is outwith the scope of today's task, so let's focus instead on flat-file databases.


As mentioned previously, flat-file databases are stored as a file on the disk of a computer. Usually this would not be a problem for a webapp, but what happens if the database is stored underneath the root directory of the website (i.e. one of the files that a user connecting to the website is able to access)? Well, we can download it and query it on our own machine, with full access to everything in the database. Sensitive Data Exposure indeed


That is a big hint for the challenge, so let's briefly cover some of the syntax we would use to query a flat-file database.


The most common (and simplest) format of flat-file database is an sqlite database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages, and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line. This client is called "sqlite3", and is installed by default on Kali.


```console
kali@kali:~/THM$ sqlite3 /home/kali/Downloads/webapp.db 
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

# Day 4 XML External Entity 
An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data. It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend or external systems that the application itself can access and can allow the attacker to read the file on that system. They can also cause Denial of Service (DoS) attack or could use XXE to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) inducing the web application to make requests to other applications. XXE may even enable port scanning and lead to remote code execution.


There are two types of XXE attacks: in-band and out-of-band (OOB-XXE).
1. An in-band XXE attack is the one in which the attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.
2. out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application and attacker has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file or their own server.

## What is XML?
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is a markup language used for storing and transporting data. 

### Why we use XML?
1. XML is platform-independent and programming language independent, thus it can be used on any system and supports the technology change when that happens.
2. The data stored and transported using XML can be changed at any point in time without affecting the data presentation.
3. XML allows validation using DTD and Schema. This validation ensures that the XML document is free from any syntax error.
4. XML simplifies data sharing between various systems because of its platform-independent nature. XML data doesn’t require any conversion when transferred between different systems.

### Syntax

Every XML document mostly starts with what is known as XML Prolog.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

Above the line is called XML prolog and it specifies the XML version and the encoding used in the XML document. This line is not compulsory to use but it is considered a `good practice` to put that line in all your XML documents.
Every XML document must contain a `ROOT` element. For example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mail>
   <to>falcon</to>
   <from>feast</from>
   <subject>About XXE</subject>
   <text>Teach about XXE</text>
</mail>
```

In the above example the `<mail>` is the ROOT element of that document and `<to>`, `<from>`, `<subject>`, `<text>` are the children elements. If the XML document doesn't have any root element then it would be consideredwrong or invalid XML doc.


Another thing to remember is that XML is a case sensitive language. If a tag starts like `<to>` then it has to end by `</to>` and not by something like `</To>`(notice the capitalization of `T`)


Like HTML we can use attributes in XML too. The syntax for having attributes is also very similar to HTML. For example:
```xml
<text category = "message">You need to learn about XXE</text>
```
In the above example category is the attribute name and message is the attribute value.

## DTD
DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. Let us try to understand this with the help of an example. Say we have a file named `note.dtd` with the following content:
```dtd
<!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)> <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)> ]>
```
Now we can use this DTD to validate the information o some XML document and make sure that the XML file conforms to the rules of that DTD.
Ex: Below is given an XML document that uses `note.dtd`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "note.dtd">
<note>
    <to>falcon</to>
    <from>feast</from>
    <heading>hacking</heading>
    <body>XXE attack</body>
</note>
```

So now let's understand how that DTD validates the XML. Here's what all those terms used in note.dtd mean

- !DOCTYPE note -  Defines a root element of the document named note
- !ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
- !ELEMENT to - Defines the `to` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT from - Defines the `from` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT heading  - Defines the `heading` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT body - Defines the `body` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
NOTE: #PCDATA means parseable character data.
